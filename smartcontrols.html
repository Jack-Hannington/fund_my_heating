                <h5>What are Smart Thermostats?</h5>
                <p class="mb-4">Smart thermostats are a smart technology that let you remotely control your home's temperature via a tablet, smartphone or desktop for greater control over your central heating. (They should not be confused with smart meters, which digitally
                    send meter readings to your energy supplier.)
                    <span class="bold-font">A Smart Thermostat will be included in your funded boiler installation, however if your boiler is under 8 years old, you could qualify for a new FREE thermostat.</span>
                </p>
                <h5>How smart thermostats work</h5>
                <p class="mb-4">A typical room thermostat just lets you change the temperature in your home using a dial or control panel. A smart thermostat gives you more efficient, more user friendly and more accessible control over your homeâ€™s heating using three
                    basic components. The first component plugs directly into your boiler and can wirelessly talk to the second comonent, the in-home device that is the thermostat and main control. The third component is an app that is downloaded to a
                    smartphone (or tablet). Users remotely control the thermostat/main control device via the app, allowing them to adjust their heating from wherever they may be. This is the basic makeup of most smart thermostats. Some smart thermostats
                    offer more, such as 'learning' your schedule by detecting when your smartphone is in the house, or even taking it step further by detecting when you're on your usual route home, and preparing your home to the desired tempature.

                </p>
                <h5>So how does a smart thermostat benefit me?</h5>
                <p class="mb-4">The ability to remotely control a home's temperature appeals to those with hectic schedules; if you have a late-running meeting there's no reason to heat an empty home, right? On holiday and realised you forgot to turn off the heat? Fixing
                    the error is just a few taps away on your smartphone. Smart thermostats don't directly save you money the way switching energy supplier can. However, they provide the ability to heat your home more efficiently which should save you
                    in the long run. You will also receive reports about your usage, which can help you better understand your heating usage, and adjust your behaviour and preferences accordingly to save money.
