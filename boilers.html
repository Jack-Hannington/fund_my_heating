                <h5>Pay monthly for your new boiler with no deposit to pay</h5>
                <p>If you don't qualify for a boiler grant, or you've missed out because of recent cuts to funding, paying monthly for your new boiler could be a perfect option. You can now spread the cost of your new boiler in to monthly payments which
                    you can afford, and you do not need to pay any deposit. Payments can start from just £10.80 a month.</p>
                <p>Well, simply put, why wouldn't you? Typically a new boiler could cost anywhere in the region of £1,500 - £3,000 depending on the work required. That's a lot of money to stomach in one go. So, why not spread the cost in to manageable monthly
                    chunks?
                </p>
                <p>Pay monthly boiler schemes are growing in popularity, the finance is easy to access and you can even get a new boiler installed with no deposit. There is even help for those who have a not so perfect credit history. See if you can get
                    a boiler on a pay monthly scheme.</p>
                <p>As long as you're in some form of employment (full time or part time) and you've not had any CCJ's or IVA's within the past 5 years, you should be eligible. Your home must also be on a mains gas supply and already have a boiler in place.</p>
