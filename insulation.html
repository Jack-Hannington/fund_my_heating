                <h5>What is cavity wall insulation?</h5>
                <p class="mb-4">Cavity wall insulation involves placing insulating material in the gap between the inner and outer bricks of your property. This makes it more energy-efficient by preventing heat escaping. Over a third of all the heat lost in an uninsulated
                    home escapes through the walls. Cavity wall insulation lowers your energy costs and helps reduce harmful emissions being released into the environment.

                    polystyrene (EPS) is a lightweight cellular material consisting of fine spherical shaped particles which are comprised of 98% air and 2% polystyrene. It is a rigid cellular plastic containing an expansion agent called pentane. EPS Bead has low thermal
                    conductivity and low moisture absorption.It is lightweight, safe and easy to use. What are the benefits? Insulating your walls can reduce your energy bills by up to 1/3 whilst increased energy-efficiency helps lower your impact on
                    the environment.

                <h5>What is loft insultaiton</h5>
                <p class="mb-4">Loft insulation is a mineral wool fibre which is placed between and over the joists in your loft or attic. This stops the heat in your home rising upwards and escaping through your roof. Heat rises in your home and escapes quickly through
                    your roof. Insulating material makes it increasingly difficult for heat to pass through the roof, trapping the escaping heat and effectively keeping it in your living area. Mineral wool insulating material is placed in between and
                    over the joists in your attic or roof. It can also be used to insulate your loft hatch and any water tanks or pipes in your attic space.

                <h5>About the ECO insulation grant scheme</h5>
                <p class="mb-4">Government wall insulation grants are designed to prevent your home losing heat. In England it is estimated that over 30% of emissions come from domestic properties The government has committed to reducing carbon emissions by 100% by 2050
                    compared with 1990 levels (Climate Change Act 2008). This is part of an international effort to cut emisions and to improve the environment on a worldwide level
